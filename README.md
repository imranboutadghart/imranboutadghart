👋 Hi there, I'm @imranboutadghart!

🎶 Music and 💻 computer science are my passions! You can often find me lost in the world of tunes with my trusty headphones 🎧 or deep in thought, exploring the intricacies of algorithms and code 🖥️.

🌐 I've dipped my toes into the world of web development 🕸️, and while I'm still at a basic level, I'm eager to dive deeper into the web's endless possibilities.

🧠 Currently, I'm on a journey to master the art of C programming 🖱️. It's my way of getting even closer to the heart of computers and uncovering their mysteries.

📬 If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to drop me an email at imranboutadghart1@gmail.com. I'm always up for a good conversation or collaborating on exciting projects! 📧🚀
